Hi!!! I am a 4th-year PhD student in CIS at Temple University 🦉, advised by Prof. [Eduard Dragut](https://cis.temple.edu/~edragut/). I received my Master degree in Artificial Intelligence and Automation from Huazhong Univeristy of Sci & Tech (HUST) advised by Prof. [Min Ouyang](https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&user=1QNTooQAAAAJ). I received my bachelor's degree in Electrical Engineering and Automation from Wuhan University of Technology.


I explore Agentic AI for Education, Social Good, and Scientific Research, with my work focusing on two main directions:

- **Agentic AI and Distillation**: Proposing novel Agentic AI methods to address challenges in social content analysis and GUI navigation agents, and distilling agentic reasoning into smaller LLMs through fine-tuning or reinforcement learning (RL).

- **Human-AI Collaboration**: Advancing Agentic AI with human-in-the-loop for qualitative analysis, meme understanding, and long scientific document analysis, pioneering active and efficient self-improvement from human feedback.
